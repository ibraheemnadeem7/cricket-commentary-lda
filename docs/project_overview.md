# Project Overview

## Title
**What Is the Difference in Commentary for a Test Match and a T20 Match?  
A Topic Modeling Analysis Using LDA**

---

## Background

Cricket is the second most popular sport globally, with an estimated 2.5 billion fans. As the sport has evolved, so too have its formats — most notably the emergence of **Twenty20 (T20)** cricket alongside the traditional **Test format**.

While gameplay differences between these formats are well studied, **how commentary language changes across formats has received little formal analysis**. Anecdotally, long-time fans believe that Test cricket commentary is more technical and analytical, whereas T20 commentary prioritizes accessibility and entertainment.

This project addresses that gap using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to quantitatively analyze and compare commentary language across formats.
