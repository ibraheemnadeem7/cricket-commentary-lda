# Limitations and Future Work

## Limitations

1. **Dataset Size**
   - While substantial, the dataset could be expanded with more matches for stronger generalization.

2. **Geographic Bias**
   - Many Test matches were played in England and the West Indies, favoring seam-friendly conditions and fast bowling topics.

3. **Temporal Bias**
   - Most Test matches were post-2021, after the introduction of the World Test Championship.
   - Commentary style may have shifted toward accessibility.

4. **Model Constraints**
   - LDA assumes bag-of-words representation, ignoring word order and context.

## Future Work

- Include **ODI cricket** as a middle ground format
- Compare **Test commentary from the 1990s vs post-2020**
- Apply **dynamic topic modeling** across match timelines
- Explore **BERTopic or transformer-based models**
- Conduct sentiment-topic interaction analysis
